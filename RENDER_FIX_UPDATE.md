# 🚀 PartiVox Render Deployment Fix - Updated

## ❌ Issue Identified
The error logs show that Apache's `mod_rewrite` module is not enabled on Render:
```
Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
```

## ✅ Solution Applied
1. **Removed `.htaccess` files** - These don't work on Render's PHP environment
2. **Updated `router.php`** - Now handles all routing in PHP without Apache dependencies
3. **Added health check path** to `render.yaml`

## 🔧 What Changed

### Router.php Updates:
- ✅ Removed dependency on Apache mod_rewrite
- ✅ Added proper static file serving
- ✅ Added MIME type detection for files
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Added directory index handling

### Removed Files:
- ❌ `.htaccess` (Apache-specific)
- ❌ `api/.htaccess` (Apache-specific)

### Added Files:
- ✅ `api/test.php` - Simple test endpoint

The Apache mod_rewrite error should now be completely resolved! 🎉
